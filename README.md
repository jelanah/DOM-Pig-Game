# DOM-Pig-Game
Pig game using JavaScript, CSS3 and HTML5.


# Game Rules: 
There are 2 players.

One by one, each player may choose to roll the dice or hold their score. 
The sum of the dice rolled during each round may be added to their total score if the player chooses to hold. 
When a player rolls a 1, their round score is set to 0 and it is the next player's turn.
